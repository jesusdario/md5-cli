# md5-cli

Dead simple. You type:

```bash
md5-cli "Your string"
```

and it prompts the result: `319557b02e00284cd64cde1c4bbfe2e5`

Works also on files:
```bash
md5-cli "index.js"

```

# Installation
```
npm install -g md5-cli
```

## Motivation

`md5 string` does not work in Mac. It only works on files. Now it works for both.
